# Project1-306




## Guidelines

> Make changes on new branches with appropriate names.

> Move the tasks to the correct places in the backlog.




## From Project Breif
MilestonesThere are three milestones for the project implementation.

### Plan
Develop a plan for your project, using a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), derive a NetworkDiagram from the WBS to show dependences between the tasks and put this into a Gantt Chart fordetailed planning.

**Basic milestone**

For the most basic milestone your implementation needs to be able to:

•Read the input file and number of processors and create an output file

•The output file needs to contain a valid schedule (which does not need to be optimal at thispoint).


**Final milestone**

The final milestone is the complete implementation. It needs to be able to (inorder of importance),

•Create an optimal schedule for small input graphs in reasonable time (say less than 30 minutes)

•Have a parallel version of the search that demonstrates speedup in comparison to the sequentialversion

•Have a meaningful and interesting live visualisation of the search5.


### Assessment
Total for this project:  **50%**

• Projectplan  **(5%)**, due week 2(Tue  30  Jul  9:30am)

• Basicmilestone, **(15%)**, demo/interview/implementation, week4 (implementation due Mon 12Aug 9:30am; Mon/Tue/Wed/Thu 12/13/14/15  Aug  demo/interviews)

• Finalmilestone, due week 6(implementation due Mon 26 Aug 9:30am; Mon/Tue/Wed/Thu 26/27/28/29Aug demo/interviews;reportdue  30  Aug  12:30pm; peerevaluation due 30 Aug 11:59pm)

– Demo/interview/implementation, **(20%)**

– Writtenreport, **(10%)**

The milestones will be graded according to various criteria.
These are functionality (finding optimal schedule), speed (time to find the optimal schedule ), high quality of coding standards, comments, documentation and testing. This project has the particular challenge of the contradicting objectives of high software engineering standards of design and code, and the need to have very fast execution speed.
